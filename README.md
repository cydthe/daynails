Nail appointment booking and Pricing website

What does this website do?

- Showcase different nail designs the nail tech has completed in the past.
- Provide users with the ability to book a nail appointment and receive an estimate price.

How accurate is the price estimate, and how are the estimates calculated?

- The price estimate's accuracy depends on whether the user decides to book a general appointment
  without providing any details about the nails they want or they customize the nails they want on the website

How do general appointments work?
- General appointments are just straightforward bookings that only take into account the client and customer availability.
  Upon booking, the customer will get a general price range in which they can expect to be paying. But it may not be accurate at all.

How do customizable appointments work?
- Based on the materials which the client has, the customer will have the options to choose the kind of nail they want: size, color, design, accesories, etc.
- Taking all of the customizations into account, there will be an estimated price calculation given to the user upon booking

How do I pay for my appointment?
- All payments will be made in cash or in person through zelle once the nails are completed
